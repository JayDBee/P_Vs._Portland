# P_Vs._Portland
Daniel Becerra 2021

P Vs. Portland is a website/ webapp that was created to help people find things to do by recommending events. The application functions by scraping data from selected website and collets them to randomize event recomendations. The hopes for this project is to help people with new and unique experiences in the Portland area.

Currently, the website only has a selected amount of website to choose from so recommendations are limited.

Navigational and search software will be used to help list and give additional information about the activity listing.
